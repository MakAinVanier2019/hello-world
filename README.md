My Programming Experience: 
  3.5 years on Feb 05/2019.
  
Languages I Can Use: 
  Turing, Pascal, Python, C#, C++, JavaScript
  
Future Aspirations:
  To further study Computer Science @University and further develop my skills to problem solve and create solutions using algorithms that   are both efficient and correct. Also to work in the field of AI and Biotechnology to take VR to the next level.
  
What I like about Computer Programming:
  I like developing ideas and ways to tackle a problem and solve it in the best possible way, and search for better ways to solve similar   problems due to having the ability to come up with several solutions when programming.
  
What I dislike about Computer Programming:
  Programming is very fun for me so there isn't much I dislike. If there is one thing that bothers me, its the inflexibility of a project
  proposal. When working on a large project all the things about the program should be outlined beforehand, leaving very little to ability
  to change or add more things to make the program better when actually coding.
