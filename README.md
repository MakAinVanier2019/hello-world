A place to store ideas, resources, and discussions.

My Programming Experience: 
  5 years on Sept 14/2020.
  
Languages I Can Use: 
  Turing, Pascal, Python, C#, C++, JavaScript
  
Future Aspirations:
  To further study Computer Science and Business at University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. Also to develop my skills in problem solving and creating solutions using algorithms that are both efficient and correct. Also to work in the field of Business Techonologies, AI, Data Science, or Software Development to further develop my knowledge and teamwork skills.
  
What I like about Computer Programming:
  I like developing ideas and ways to tackle a problem and solve it in the best possible way, and the satisfaction obtained from seeing improvements by coming up with better innovative solutions when working in a business or a programming environment.
  
What I dislike about Computer Programming:
  Programming is fun for me so there isn't much I dislike. If there is one thing that bothers me, its the inflexibility and uncertainty of a new project when it's difficult to change things later on. However, using GitHub makes this a lot easier, especially when collaborating with a team on different parts and having the ability to make changes to past decisions.
